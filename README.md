# Real-Time-Notification-Event-Management-Platform
An notification system designed to route, queue, and deliver notifications across multiple channels (email, SMS, push, in-app) to end users. The platform ingests events from external applications, processes them through a microservices architecture, and exposes real-time dashboards for monitoring, analytics, and user preference management.
